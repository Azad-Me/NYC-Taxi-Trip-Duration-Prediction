# NYC-Taxi-Trip-Duration-Prediction

## Project Summary

Let's say you are have reached to an airport after completing a business trip and you want to reach home as soon as possible. Now you have opened you phone and start looking for Cabs which could take you to the home. While searching for cabs you have noticed, the application is providing you a very vital information, which is the duration, you require to reach home. You felt that how an application can calculate the duration of an journey even before its completion ,whether this duration is just an assumption or have been calculated after evaluating a rigorous algorithm.
So, the answer to this question lies inside this beautiful project.The project revolves around the prediction of regression values after evaluating some independent variables. In addition with it, project performs a EDA on the NYC dataset to find out hidden secrets for the business.
